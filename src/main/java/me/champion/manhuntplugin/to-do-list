Ideas:
    Create an inventory with a /MhSettings that allows you to choose particles, bossBar colour and add more customisation

    Anti combat log

    Rewrite in Kotlin (pain)

    Cursed manhunt:
        Lower tick rate
        Slow pause/unpause
        Random time to unpause

    Custom manhunt client

    Add way to enable/disable MhIntro

    Add duration to statistics tracking
    Add wins/losses (locked to starting teams)

    Create multiple versions of the same text for joining teams


Unfixed:
    zombie win event not triggered (after server restart?)

    Saving information between restarts

    Death detection only works sometimes?
    //Unsure how to reproduce, there were some inefficiencies baked into the onplayer death class due to having a check that no one had died in the last 5 seconds to prevent the same evnet being called multiple times which may have been its cause?

Fixed:
    Nerf skeletons
    //DamageNerf class, 50% damage

    Made particles work on moving players
