Ideas:
    Create an inventory with a /MhSettings that allows you to choose particles, bossBar colour and add more customisation

    Anti combat log

    Rewrite in Kotlin (pain)

    Cursed manhunt:
        Lower tick rate
        Slow pause/unpause
        Random time to unpause

Unfixed:
    SERVER PERFORMANCE

    MhIntro can be ran by anyone, at any time, any number of times

    When zombie kills zombie message is blue

    Improper kill credit (push of cliff = environment), also death messages should be more helpful

    On runner win, no fireworks spawned on zombies

    Add way to enable/disable mhintro
