Ideas:
    Create an inventory with a /MhSettings that allows you to choose particles, bossBar colour and add more customisation

    Anti combat log

    Rewrite in Kotlin (pain)

    Cursed manhunt:
        Lower tick rate
        Slow pause/unpause
        Random time to unpause

Unfixed:

    Auto-save causes lag
    //Server config issue, make auto-save much less frequent/disable them (if the server crashes we cope?)

    issues with player movement on rejoin ( unpause/pause states are not properly recognised when joining)

    I think we should make the statistics counter more lenient, rather than needing a player to deal the final blow, just needing them to attack the player within a few seconds of their death for a kill and to not count friendly fire kills
    However, I(A) have no good way of testing this on localhost so we can either figure it out together at some point or you can do it with ur alt? idk

Fixed:
