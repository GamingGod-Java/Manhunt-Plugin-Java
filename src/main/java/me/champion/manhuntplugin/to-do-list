ToggleFlight in server.properties

Remove "The game runs normally" server announcements from pausing and unpausing the game

Make players invincible on pause and save things that could be doing damage, like lava etc. and load that again,
when the game is being unpaused

Make the /MhMove command autocomplete teams "Zombies", "Runners" and "None"

Fix small issues and null pointers

//Still doesn't work because I have not implemented a boss bar
  MhRestart:
    description: Resets the /MhStart timer, allows to restart the game
    usage: /mhrestart

  Mhstart:
    description: Starts the 10-second countdown in chat and disables team selection
    usage: /MhStart

MhCreate command displays a white text saying You do not have permission to use this command instead of red (example)
the /mhready command

Weird logic with saving and restoring teams upon relogging

If you move an offline player it moves you instead to the team instead of the person you are trying to move,
disable moving offline players

BossBar not counting down properly

Make a toggle team chat

Make the compasses enchanted and unstackable

Tells runner 3 times upon respawn that they have been given a compass, see what's causing this issue?
Probably the respawn logic inside of TeamManager.java

Zombies frozen on countdown are not invincible, needs fixing

Check if the game is in a state where the BossBar should be visible, and if so, add the player to the BossBar

Fix logic where player doesn't get unpaused if they relog and /MhRestart is typed

Make all error messages red

Save potion state, while paused constantly clear and reapply it until the pause is over, then just apply it once,
this will give the illusion of potion effects being frozen
