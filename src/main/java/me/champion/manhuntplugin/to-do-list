Plugin: Chunky

ideas:
    Create an inventory with a /MhSettings that allows you to choose particles, bossBar colour and add more customisation

    Anti combat log

    Rewrite in Kotlin (pain)

    Cursed manhunt:
        Lower tick rate
        Slow pause/unpause
        Random time to unpause

Unfixed:
    ban beds

    nothing on relog

    autosave causes lag


    Clicking on a GUI slot with nothing in it will produce an error in the console
    //for some reason I(J) can't replicate this
    //I(A) also cannot replicate it

    Statistics counting
Fixed:
    Need saturation in "pregame"
    //just give players saturation in lobby, clear effect on game start, give player saturation if game not started

    stronghold???
    //See EyeofEnderListener

    Set day on start
    // /time set 0 on start

    Set hard
    //edited similarly to enabling flight

    Set survival on unpause
    //Stopped setting to adventure

    Execute mhrestart on win
    //Bukkit.dispatch command just straight up runs "/mhrestart"

    Make game listener not apply to OPS
    //just check each listener,efficiency is cringe

    MhRestart doesn't restart win condition but we'll fix that later
    //Apparently we(I) are dumb and winning on time was always impossible/broken? fixed now
