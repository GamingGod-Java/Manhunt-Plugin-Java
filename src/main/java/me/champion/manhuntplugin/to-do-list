Plugin: FastChunkPregenerator

ideas:
    Create an inventory with a /MhSettings that allows you to choose particles, bossBar colour and add more customisation

    Anti combat log

    Rewrite in Kotlin (pain)

    Cursed manhunt:
        Lower tickrate
        Slow pause/unpause
        Random time to unpause

Unfixed:

    execute mhrestart on win

    Clicking on a GUI slot with nothing in it will produce an error in the console //for some reason I can't replicate this

Fixed:
    Colours in chat on Zombie death
    //Added colours in chat and fixed chat bug caused by idiot coding

    % sign breaks custom chat
    //Chatgpt suggestion was just replace all instances of % with %%, seems disturbingly effective, but if theres another character it will explode

    Make waiting players unable to break glass
    //Set all players to adventure mode on mhcreate then survival on mhstart, is there any reason to implement a more intelligent solution?

    MhRestart doesn't restart win condition but we'll fix that later
    //Apparently we(I) are dumb and winning on time was always impossible/broken? fixed now
