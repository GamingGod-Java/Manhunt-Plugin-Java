Plugin: Chunky

ideas:
    Create an inventory with a /MhSettings that allows you to choose particles, bossBar colour and add more customisation

    Anti combat log

    Rewrite in Kotlin (pain)

    Cursed manhunt:
        Lower tick rate
        Slow pause/unpause
        Random time to unpause

Unfixed:

    Execute MhRestart on win

    Clicking on a GUI slot with nothing in it will produce an error in the console
    //for some reason I can't replicate this

    Make MhRestart clear potion effects and other things

Fixed:
    MhRestart doesn't restart win condition but we'll fix that later
    //Apparently we(I) are dumb and winning on time was always impossible/broken? fixed now
