Remove "The game runs normally" server announcements from pausing and unpausing the game
//This is related to the tick freeze/unfreeze command the server executes

Logging out during a pause, on rejoin, still makes your walk speed 0? (andre)

Make the /MhMove command autocomplete teams "Zombies", "Runners" and "None" (done)

Fix small issues and null pointers

If you move an offline player it moves you instead to the team instead of the person you are trying to move,
disable moving offline players

Make a toggle team chat

Make the compasses unstackable (?)

Add pause and unpause check when players log in to see if they should be paused or unpaused?

Players in boats are now frozen but the boat can move without them? (this is the best fix i could get, they cant get out of boat, i can try more later but ive spent like 2 hours straight on this and i want to save something)
