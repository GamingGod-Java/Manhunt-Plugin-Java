Ideas:U
    Create an inventory with a /MhSettings that allows you to choose particles, bossBar colour and add more customisation

    Anti combat log

    Rewrite in Kotlin (pain)

    Cursed manhunt:
        Lower tick rate
        Slow pause/unpause
        Random time to unpause

Unfixed:
    SERVER PERFORMANCE

    Add way to enable/disable MhIntro

    MhMove doesn't play sound

    Add confirmation to /mhrestart due to similarities with /mhr

    Add date, time, and duration to statistics tracking

    Add wins/losses (locked to starting teams)

    The TeamMove class is supposed to be called MhMove

Fixed:
    When Zombie kills Zombie message is blue
    //Rewrote player death logic, statistics tracking now based on death message

    On runner win, no fireworks spawned on zombies
    //Just changed WinCondition to spawn for everyone and not just Runners on Runner win /shrug

    MhIntro can be ran by anyone, at any time, any number of times
    //I might have fixed it? (chatgpt and I don't have pack to test with
