Ideas:
    Create an inventory with a /MhSettings that allows you to choose particles, bossBar colour and add more customisation

    Anti combat log

    Rewrite in Kotlin (pain)

    Cursed manhunt:
        Lower tick rate
        Slow pause/unpause
        Random time to unpause

    Custom manhunt client

    Add way to enable/disable MhIntro

    Add duration to statistics tracking
    Add wins/losses (locked to starting teams)

    Create multiple versions of the same text for joining teams


Unfixed:
    Dragon not perching (may be linked to peaceful mode)
    //just dont set it to peaceful

    zombie win event not triggered (after server restart?)

    The TeamMove class is supposed to be called MhMove

    Saving information between restarts

    Particles need to stay at set distance from player

    Saturation in pregame

    Death detection only works sometimes?
    //Unsure how to reproduce


Fixed:
    Nerf skeletons
    //DamageNerf class, 50% damage
