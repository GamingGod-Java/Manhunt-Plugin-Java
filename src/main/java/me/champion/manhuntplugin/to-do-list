ToggleFlight in server.properties

Clean up MhStart countdown cancellation, maybe rewrite the Start sequence to include a cancel from the start

Put Team into folders

Put MhReady, Pause and Unpause into folders

Remove the chat spam from selection a zombie or runner team, maybe by only sending the message to the player,
if they are switching from runner to zombie and zombie to runner

Remove "The game runs normally" server announcements from pausing and unpausing the game

Make players invincible on pause and save things that could be doing damage, like lava etc. and load that again,
when the game is being unpaused (fixed drowning damage and player is invincible, what else is there???)

Make the /MhMove command autocomplete teams "Zombies", "Runners" and "None"

Fix small issues and null pointers

MhCreate command displays a white text saying You do not have permission to use this command instead of red (example)
the /mhready command

Weird logic with saving and restoring teams upon relogging (fixed)

If you move an offline player it moves you instead to the team instead of the person you are trying to move,
disable moving offline players

Remove the "<Player> has joined the <team> because other players can't and shouldn't see it anyway"

Make a toggle team chat

Make the compasses unstackable (?)

Tells runner 3 times upon respawn that they have been given a compass, see what's causing this issue?
Probably the respawn logic inside of TeamManager.java
(Found and solved issue, logic for respawning was included in mhcompass and team manager, also updated team manager respawn)

Why are compasses created in two different places lmao command and respawn, needs fixing

If player A types /MhPause and player B types /MhUnpause the game only unpauses for player B and player A is stuck (their walk speed is set to 0.0)

Add pause and unpause check when players log in to see if they should be paused or unpaused?
