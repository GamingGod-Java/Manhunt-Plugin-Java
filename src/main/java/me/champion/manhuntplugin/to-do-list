Unfixed:
    Update Zombie join message upon respawn

    Create an inventory with a /MhSettings that allows you to choose particles, bossBar colour and add more customisation

    Chat message deletion upon reentering boats?

    /MhCreate doesn't work with kelp_plant and tall_seagrass, I need to fix that but I'm too lazy rn

    /MhRestart doesn't restart win condition but we'll fix that later

    When unpausing with /MhUnpause or /MhReady it does /tick unfreeze twice

    Remove speed 2 and add last man standing icon (maybe a beacon)

    Inventory GUI returns "Invalid Target Player" in chat, when trying to click on an empty slot in the player list section

    Colours in chat on Zombie death
Fixed:
    Colours in chat on death
    //Created new chat message to override vanilla message on death
        // -Thank you

    Remove "The game runs normally" server announcements from pausing and unpausing the game
        //This is related to the tick freeze/unfreeze command the server executes
        //ChatGPT: "...which may or may not be feasible depending on the plugin's licensing and your programming skills," throwing shade lol.
            // - "your programming skills, damn.. thank you ChatGPT..."
