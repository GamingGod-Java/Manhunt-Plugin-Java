Plugin: FastChunkPregenerator

ideas:
    Create an inventory with a /MhSettings that allows you to choose particles, bossBar colour and add more customisation

    Anti combat log

    Rewrite in Kotlin (pain)

    Cursed manhunt:
        Lower tickrate
        Slow pause/unpause
        Random time to unpause

Unfixed:
    mhcreate should set world spawn
    //chatgpts suggested code doenst work help

    Save zombie debuffs on death

    Make giving items work

    Update Zombie join message upon respawn


    When unpausing with /MhUnpause or /MhReady it does /tick unfreeze twice

    Inventory GUI returns "Invalid Target Player" in chat, when trying to click on an empty slot in the player list section

    Colours in chat on Zombie death

Fixed:
    % sign breaks custom chat
    //Chatgpt suggestion was just replace all instances of % with %%, seems disturbingly effective

    Make waiting players unable to break glass
    //Set all players to adventure mode on mhcreate then survival on mhstart

    MhRestart doesn't restart win condition but we'll fix that later
    //Apparently we are  dumb and winning on time was always impossible/broken? fixed now

    Clear players on restart
    //done

    /MhCreate doesn't work with kelp_plant and tall_seagrass, I need to fix that but I'm too lazy rn
    //and now it does

    Add fire res buff
    //Added



    Colours in chat on death
    //Created new chat message to override vanilla message on death
        // -Thank you

    Remove "The game runs normally" server announcements from pausing and unpausing the game
        //This is related to the tick freeze/unfreeze command the server executes
        //ChatGPT: "...which may or may not be feasible depending on the plugin's licensing and your programming skills," throwing shade lol.
            // - "your programming skills, damn.. thank you ChatGPT..."
