Unfixed:

    Remove "The game runs normally" server announcements from pausing and unpausing the game

    //This is related to the tick freeze/unfreeze command the server executes

    Fix small issues and null pointers

    Make the plugin create a Manhunt folder with an empty playersdate.yml file if there is none on the first startup
    and then restart the server, unless there already is one

    Update Zombie join message upon respawn

    Create an inventory with a /MhSettings that allows you to choose particles, bossBar colour and add more customisation

    Colours in chat on death

    Chat message deletion upon reentering boats?

Fixed:
    No freeze if a team wins (jank fix)

    Make potion effects stop counting down (fixed)

    Make lava turn into red glass, turn water and sea related things into blue stained glass (darker)
    //Done, but you cant really see the glass under lava lol

???:
       Found an issue with /MhRestart spamming console, issue is probably related to the bossBar
       //I was unable to reproduce this error, have you fixed it?
