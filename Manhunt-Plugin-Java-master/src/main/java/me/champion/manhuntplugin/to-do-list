Ideas:
    Create an inventory with a /MhSettings that allows you to choose particles, bossBar colour and add more customisation

    Anti combat log

    Rewrite in Kotlin (pain)

    Cursed manhunt:
        Lower tick rate
        Slow pause/unpause
        Random time to unpause

    Custom manhunt client

    Add way to enable/disable MhIntro

    Add duration to statistics tracking
    Add wins/losses (locked to starting teams)

    Create multiple versions of the same text for joining teams

   asdfsa

Unfixed:
    Disable inventory management during pause?

    When glass sphere disappears, it doesnt replace snow/grass it destroyed

    Autocomplete in mhmove is broken, maybe because it only works on capital letters

    Change how to get kit to avoid instance suicide

    Statistics redo

    should only track statistics if we type /mhstart track

    Organise tab list

    Add spawn to positions when mhiso is created

    Joseph dislikes click to update (compass should autoupdate)

    triple message

    "Very mediocre compass"
Fixed:
