Ideas:U
    Create an inventory with a /MhSettings that allows you to choose particles, bossBar colour and add more customisation

    Anti combat log

    Rewrite in Kotlin (pain)

    Cursed manhunt:
        Lower tick rate
        Slow pause/unpause
        Random time to unpause

Unfixed:
    SERVER PERFORMANCE

    Add way to enable/disable MhIntro

    Mhmove doesnt play sound

    Add confirmation to /mhrestart due to similarities with /mhr

    Add date, time, and duration to statistics tracking

    Add wins/losses (locked to starting teams)


Fixed:
    When zombie kills zombie message is blue
    //Rewrote player death logic, statistics tracking now based on death message

    On runner win, no fireworks spawned on zombies
    //Just changed wincondition to spawn for everyone and not just runners on runner win /shrug

    MhIntro can be ran by anyone, at any time, any number of times
    //I might have fixed it? (chatgpt and i dont have pack to test with
