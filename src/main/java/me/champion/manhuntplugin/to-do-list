Ideas:
    Create an inventory with a /MhSettings that allows you to choose particles, bossBar colour and add more customisation

    Anti combat log

    Rewrite in Kotlin (pain)

    Cursed manhunt:
        Lower tick rate
        Slow pause/unpause
        Random time to unpause

Unfixed:
    SERVER PERFORMANCE

    MhIntro can be ran by anyone, at any time, any number of times

    On runner win, no fireworks spawned on zombies

    Add way to enable/disable MhIntro
Fixed:
    When zombie kills zombie message is blue
    //Rewrote player death logic, statistics tracking now based on death message
