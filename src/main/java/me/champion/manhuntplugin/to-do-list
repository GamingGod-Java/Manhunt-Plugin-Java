Plugin: Chunky

ideas:
    Create an inventory with a /MhSettings that allows you to choose particles, bossBar colour and add more customisation

    Anti combat log

    Rewrite in Kotlin (pain)

    Cursed manhunt:
        Lower tick rate
        Slow pause/unpause
        Random time to unpause

Unfixed:
    Need saturation in "pregame"

    Set day on start

    Set hard

    Set survival on unpause

    ban beds

    nothing on relog

    autosave causes lag

    stronghold???

    Clicking on a GUI slot with nothing in it will produce an error in the console
    //for some reason I can't replicate this

    Statistics counting
Fixed:
    Execute mhrestart on win
    //Bukkit.dispatch command just straight up runs "/mhrestart"

    Make game listener not apply to OPS
    //just check each listener,efficiency is cringe

    MhRestart doesn't restart win condition but we'll fix that later
    //Apparently we(I) are dumb and winning on time was always impossible/broken? fixed now
