Plugin: FastChunkPregenerator

ideas:
    Create an inventory with a /MhSettings that allows you to choose particles, bossBar colour and add more customisation

    Anti combat log

    Rewrite in Kotlin (pain)

    Cursed manhunt:
        Lower tickrate
        Slow pause/unpause
        Random time to unpause

Unfixed:
    mhcreate should set world spawn
    //chatgpts suggested code doenst work help

    Update Zombie join message upon respawn

    Plaers joining after mhcreate will not be put into adventure mode
Fixed:
    Save zombie debuffs on death
    //Needed to add delay to respawn, onplayerrespawn is called *before* player respawns

    When unpausing with /MhUnpause or /MhReady it does /tick unfreeze twice
    //I believe its fixed? Called in team manager and mhpause/unpause

    Inventory GUI returns "Invalid Target Player" in chat, when trying to click on an empty slot in the player list section
    //Added check for what slot # is being pressed and if the current team is that large

    Make giving items work
    //It was kinda ur fault, the function calls twice but you dont notice it with potion effects, so ive just added a very short "cooldown" to the functions actions

    Colours in chat on Zombie death
    //Added colours in chat and fixed chat bug caused by idiot coding

    % sign breaks custom chat
    //Chatgpt suggestion was just replace all instances of % with %%, seems disturbingly effective, but if theres another character it will explode

    Make waiting players unable to break glass
    //Set all players to adventure mode on mhcreate then survival on mhstart, is there any reason to implement a more intelligent solution?

    MhRestart doesn't restart win condition but we'll fix that later
    //Apparently we(I) are dumb and winning on time was always impossible/broken? fixed now
