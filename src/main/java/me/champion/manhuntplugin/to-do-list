Plugin: Chunky

ideas:
    Create an inventory with a /MhSettings that allows you to choose particles, bossBar colour and add more customisation

    Anti combat log

    Rewrite in Kotlin (pain)

    Cursed manhunt:
        Lower tick rate
        Slow pause/unpause
        Random time to unpause

Unfixed:
    no boss bar on relog

    autosave causes lag
    //Server config issue, make autosaves much less frequent/disable them (if the server crashes we cope?)

    I think we should make the statistics counter more lenient, rather than needing a player to deal the final blow, just needing them to attack the player within a few seconds of their death for a kill and to not count friendly fire kills
    However, I(A) have no good way of testing this on localhost so we can either figure it out together at some point or you can do it with ur alt? idk

    Clicking on a GUI slot with nothing in it will produce an error in the console
    //for some reason I(J) can't replicate this
    //I(A) also cannot replicate it
Fixed:
    ban beds
    //DisableBedBomb.java (i love making new classes for organisation)

    Need saturation in "pregame"
    //just give players saturation in lobby, clear effect on game start, give player saturation if game not started

    stronghold???
    //See EyeofEnderListener

    Set day on start
    // /time set 0 on start

    Set hard
    //edited similarly to enabling flight

    Set survival on unpause
    //Stopped setting to adventure

    Execute mhrestart on win
    //Bukkit.dispatch command just straight up runs "/mhrestart"

    Make game listener not apply to OPS
    //just check each listener,efficiency is cringe

    MhRestart doesn't restart win condition but we'll fix that later
    //Apparently we(I) are dumb and winning on time was always impossible/broken? fixed now
