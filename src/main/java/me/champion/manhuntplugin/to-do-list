Ideas:U
    Create an inventory with a /MhSettings that allows you to choose particles, bossBar colour and add more customisation

    Anti combat log

    Rewrite in Kotlin (pain)

    Cursed manhunt:
        Lower tick rate
        Slow pause/unpause
        Random time to unpause

Unfixed:
    Add way to enable/disable MhIntro

    Add duration to statistics tracking

    Add wins/losses (locked to starting teams)

    The TeamMove class is supposed to be called MhMove

    Create multiple versions of the same text for joining teams

    Dragon not perching (may be linked to peaceful mode)

    zombie win event not triggered (after server restart?)

    Saving information between restarts

Fixed:
    When Zombie kills Zombie message is blue
    //Rewrote player death logic, statistics tracking now based on death message

    On runner win, no fireworks spawned on zombies
    //Just changed WinCondition to spawn for everyone and not just Runners on Runner win /shrug

    MhIntro can be ran by anyone, at any time, any number of times
    //I might have fixed it? (chatgpt and I don't have pack to test with)

    Added date/time to file name in sessions folder
